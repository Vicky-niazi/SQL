# üè• SQL Hospital Data Analysis Project
## üéØ Objective
### The goal of the project was to:

Analyze hospital performance metrics.

Gain insights into patient trends and resource utilization.

Practice SQL skills including filtering, aggregation, joins, date manipulation, and grouping.

 ## ‚úÖ Queries/Questions Solved in the Project:
 
* Find the total number of patients treated across all hospitals.

* Calculate the average number of doctors available per hospital.

* Identify the top 3 departments with the highest number of patients.

* Determine the hospital with the highest total medical expenses.

* Calculate the daily average medical expenses for each hospital.

* Find the patient with the longest hospital stay.

* Calculate the total number of patients treated in each city.

* Find the average length of hospital stay per department.

* Identify the department with the lowest number of patients.

* Generate a monthly report of total medical expenses throughout the year.

## üõ†Ô∏è Step-by-Step Process:

### Step 1: Data Exploration

Loaded and examined the structure of the hospital_data table.

Reviewed key columns such as patient count, doctors count, department, medical expense, admission and discharge dates.

### Step 2: Writing SQL Queries

Wrote individual SQL queries to answer each specific business question.

Used aggregation functions like SUM(), AVG(), and COUNT().

Applied GROUP BY, ORDER BY, and LIMIT clauses for grouping and sorting.

Used DATE_TRUNC() and date arithmetic to handle time-based calculations.

### Step 3: Analyzing Results

Reviewed the output of each query to extract meaningful insights.

Noted down key statistics such as hospitals with highest/lowest expenses, top-performing departments, and city-wise patient trends.

### Step 4: Documentation

Compiled all queries and results into a clean format.

Prepared a professional document (PDF) to present the analysis findings.
